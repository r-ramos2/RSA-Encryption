    "In computer science, RSA is an encryption and decryption method used to lock and unlock inverse operations. Thus, instead of sending millions upon millions of encrypted keys to clients, the brilliance of this practice lies in the key provider sharing a single open lock with all clients, who can then encrypt such their message and send it back to the provider, who, with the original key, can unlock the message. Whereas encoding a message is relatively simple, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to decode it, as the key required is held by the person who created the lock, in what could be thought of as a trapdoor.\n",

    "This self-learning experience has taught me a lot about programming in Python. For example, now I possess the knowledge to build programs that convert text strings to and fro ASCII values, transform integers into binary format, speed up modular exponentiation when calculating gargantuan numerical values and without sacrificing processing speed, encoding and decoding messages by sharing public and private keys, figuring out private keys through factorization, understanding the importance of creating secure code that protects valuable information, implementing code by means of elegant mathematical principles instead of simple code, and most fun of all, creating an interactive menu with the code presented in this project. I hope you enjoy working playing around with my code as much as I did when building it. I hope to continue improving this code as I gain more experience with Python.\n",

    "In this project, my goal is to show the user how to encode and decode messages to and fro with fellow users. This information will be presented in blocks of code that have been labeled in the simplest way that I could find, both for the benefit of the user and my own to use for future reference. The Python code presented here has been built with information gathered from various sources, from the textbook Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications by Kenneth Rosen (7e) to video lectures provided by CU Boulder professors, from exchanging ideas with my classmates in Piazza to some background knowledge that I learned through Python courses by Udemy and Codecademy, and from a few not-so-well-explained YouTube tutorials from which I managed to put ideas together through good use of pencil, paper, and a pinch of creativity.\n",

    "The process of building an RSA program was a challenging one. My greatest setback was my limited experience with Python (other than having watched a few video lectures by Udemy and Codeacademy), as well as trying to figure out code that not only works, but also that is simple for anyone to follow. Even though I spent entire days putting this project together on my own, I found Mastery Workbooks 6 and 7, corresponding lectures, Piazza exchanges, and a some inspiration from not-so-well-explained YouTube videos to be treasure troves. All in all, it was a true trial-and-error process. My most memorable mistake was trying to come up with code that would convert an entire list of ASCII values into a separate list of encoded numbers, when the guidelines only required that the messages were encoded and decoded letter by letter. Another notable challenge was trying to come up with a code that would allow me factorize a prime number. By the same token, I spent more time that I would have liked factorizing large numbers, until I realized that I was using variable n instead of phi n in order to find private key d. These setbacks ended up costing me three precious days of my time. Nevertheless, I also see it as an opportunity because I also learned a lot about Python am sure that when diving into the learning of program itself, I should have a better experience.\n",

    "RSA needs to use a Fast Modular Exponentiation (FME) function because simply trying to encode or decode very large numbers could result in the program taking an extremely long time to compile, never compiling, or even crashing. For the sake of simplicity, compare both process and call the first FME and the second FakeFME. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can choose a modulo expression at random. For example, let’s take the expression 5^n mod 17. At every new trial, concatenate to n the next highest integer in chronological order. That is to say, start with n = 0, then n = 1, then n = 12, then n = 123, and so on until you have reached ten digits for n.\n",
    "\n",
    "All else being equal, notice that when n = 123, as in 5^123 mod 17, the result in the FME program output the answer 11 but the FakeFME output the answer 11L, even though the termination time was about the same. The L in FakeFME stands for larger numbers, so we are now noticing that large numbers are starting to affect the simple mod function %.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we keep increasing the number of digits for n, see the result for FME and FakeFME look alike, with the exception of the L next to solutions of the latter, and how there is still no noticeable difference in the termination time. Moreover, when trying eight digits for n, as in 5^12345678 mod 17, see how the termination time increases significantly from around 0.040 seconds to 0.287 seconds. At this point, we can realize the efficiency of FME as compared to FakeFME.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as we test nine digits for n, as in 5^123456789 mod 17, we end up with a termination time of 0.039 second for FME and 10.094 second for FakeFME; when testing ten digits, FakeFME does not compile at all, whereas FME terminates in 0.036 second with the result 14. Thus, we can conclude that the FME algorithm is significantly more effective than the regular modulo method.\n",
